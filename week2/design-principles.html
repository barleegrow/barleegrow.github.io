            <p>Serious Eats has plenty of white space and a clean design. It is easy to navigate to the recipe 
                as well as to share it by tapping any of the icons on the top of the page. It is visually appealing 
                and not just because the photos are beautiful.</p>

            <h3>AAR</h3>

                <p>The Association of American Railroads has good visual hierarchy witht he logo on the top and the main focus on the
                    breaking news story at the top. The black contrast draws your eye to the story and the white below then becomes a
                    second focla point.

        <section><h3>Hick's Law</h3>

            <p> The American Wood Preservers Association makes it easy to choose from a limited menu. It is a good example of
                Hick's law, reducing the decision making time. With a more complex menu, the user can get frustrated and leave
                the site, or take a longer time to make a decision. Sometimes less is more.
